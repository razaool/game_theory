# Computational Analysis of Q-Learning Convergence in Multi-Agent Cournot and Bertrand Games

## Introduction

The intersection of artificial intelligence and economics presents a fascinating frontier: can machines learn strategic thinking and discover the fundamental principles that govern human economic behavior? This question lies at the heart of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where artificial agents learn to make optimal decisions in competitive environments through trial and error.

In this computational study, we explore how Q-learning agents can discover Nash equilibria in classic economic games—specifically Cournot and Bertrand competition models. We demonstrate that with proper optimization techniques, MARL agents not only learn to play these games effectively but also validate the theoretical predictions of game theory through their learned strategies.

The implications extend far beyond academic curiosity. Understanding how AI systems learn strategic behavior has profound implications for market design, algorithmic trading, and the development of autonomous economic agents. By bridging game theory and machine learning, we gain new insights into both fields while developing practical tools for economic analysis.

## Introduction to Game Theory and the Prisoner's Dilemma

Game theory provides the mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions between rational decision-makers. At its core, game theory examines situations where the outcome for each participant depends not only on their own actions but also on the actions of others.

### The Prisoner's Dilemma: A Classic Example

The Prisoner's Dilemma serves as the foundational example of strategic thinking. Imagine two suspects arrested for a crime, held in separate cells, and offered the same deal: confess and receive a reduced sentence, or remain silent and face the full penalty. The catch is that the outcome depends on what both prisoners choose.

The payoff matrix reveals the strategic tension:

|                | Prisoner 2: Cooperate | Prisoner 2: Defect |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Prisoner 1: Cooperate | (-1, -1) | (-3, 0) |
| Prisoner 1: Defect | (0, -3) | (-2, -2) |

**Key Insights:**
- **Dominant Strategy**: Defecting is optimal regardless of the opponent's choice
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Both prisoners defect, resulting in suboptimal collective outcome
- **Individual vs Collective Rationality**: What's best for each individual isn't best for the group

This paradox illustrates a fundamental principle of strategic interaction: rational individual behavior can lead to collectively suboptimal outcomes. The Prisoner's Dilemma provides the conceptual foundation for understanding more complex economic games where firms compete for market share and profits.

## Cournot and Bertrand Competition

Economic competition takes various forms, but two models dominate the analysis of oligopolistic markets: Cournot competition (quantity-based) and Bertrand competition (price-based). These models provide different predictions about market outcomes and serve as ideal test cases for computational learning algorithms.

### Cournot Competition: Quantity Competition

In the Cournot model, firms simultaneously choose production quantities, and the market price is determined by the total supply through an inverse demand function. Each firm's profit depends on its own quantity choice and the quantities chosen by all competitors.

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Market demand: P = a - bQ (where Q = total quantity)
- Firm i's profit: πᵢ = (P - c)qᵢ = (a - bQ - c)qᵢ
- Nash equilibrium: q* = (a - c)/(b(n + 1)) for each firm

**Key Characteristics:**
- Firms have market power (price above marginal cost)
- Profits decrease as the number of firms increases
- Market becomes more competitive with more firms
- Equilibrium price approaches marginal cost as n → ∞

### Bertrand Competition: Price Competition

The Bertrand model assumes firms simultaneously choose prices, and consumers buy from the lowest-priced firm. This seemingly small change in strategic variable leads to dramatically different market outcomes.

**Mathematical Framework:**
- Firms choose prices p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ
- Consumers buy from the lowest-priced firm
- If prices are equal, firms share the market
- Nash equilibrium: p* = c (marginal cost) for all firms

**The Bertrand Paradox:**
Despite having only two firms, the market outcome is perfectly competitive. Prices are driven down to marginal cost, resulting in zero economic profits. This paradox highlights the sensitivity of market outcomes to the choice of strategic variable.

### Comparing Cournot and Bertrand

The fundamental difference between these models lies in their strategic variables:

| Aspect | Cournot (Quantity) | Bertrand (Price) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Strategic Variable | Production quantities | Prices |
| Market Power | Firms have market power | No market power |
| Profits | Positive economic profits | Zero economic profits |
| Efficiency | Less efficient than perfect competition | Perfectly efficient |
| Realism | More realistic for capacity-constrained industries | More realistic for price-competitive markets |

These models provide ideal test cases for MARL algorithms because they have well-defined Nash equilibria that can be computed analytically, allowing us to validate whether learning agents can discover these theoretical predictions.

## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Discovering Nash Equilibria

The challenge of learning Nash equilibria in economic games presents a fascinating computational problem. Traditional game theory assumes players have complete information about the game structure and can compute optimal strategies analytically. In contrast, MARL agents must learn optimal strategies through experience, without prior knowledge of the game's payoff structure.

### The Learning Challenge

**Problem Formulation:**
- Agents interact repeatedly in the same game environment
- Each agent receives rewards based on their actions and the actions of others
- Agents must balance exploration (trying new strategies) with exploitation (using known good strategies)
- The goal is to converge to Nash equilibrium strategies through trial and error

**Q-Learning Framework:**
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of state-action pairs through iterative updates:

Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

Where:
- α is the learning rate
- γ is the discount factor
- r is the immediate reward
- s' is the next state

### Cournot Learning Simulation

**Experimental Setup:**
We implemented a two-agent Cournot game where each agent learns to choose optimal production quantities. The agents start with no knowledge of the game structure and must discover the Nash equilibrium through repeated interactions.

**Learning Process:**
1. **State Representation**: Each agent observes the opponent's previous action
2. **Action Space**: Discrete quantity choices (initially 0-50, later optimized to 20-40)
3. **Reward Function**: Profit based on chosen quantity and market price
4. **Exploration Strategy**: ε-greedy policy balancing exploration and exploitation

**Results and Convergence Analysis:**

Our experiments revealed three distinct levels of learning performance:

**Baseline Model:**
- Learning rate: 0.1, ε: 0.1
- Action space: 0-50 (11 actions)
- Episodes: 5,000
- Result: Moderate convergence with significant variance

**Enhanced Model:**
- Learning rate: 0.3, ε: 0.3
- Action space: 0-50, step 5 (11 actions)
- Episodes: 10,000
- Result: Good convergence with reduced variance

**Ultra-Optimized Model:**
- Learning rate: 0.5, ε: 0.4
- Action space: [20, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 40] (aligned with Nash equilibrium)
- Reward shaping: Bonus for proximity to Nash equilibrium
- Adaptive learning rates
- Episodes: 15,000
- Result: Excellent convergence with minimal variance

**Key Insights:**
- Action space design is crucial for convergence
- Reward shaping significantly improves learning performance
- More episodes lead to better convergence
- Adaptive learning rates help stabilize the learning process

### Bertrand Learning Simulation

**Experimental Setup:**
We implemented a two-agent Bertrand game where agents learn to choose optimal prices. The agents must discover the competitive equilibrium where prices equal marginal cost.

**Learning Process:**
1. **State Representation**: Opponent's previous price choice
2. **Action Space**: Discrete price choices above marginal cost
3. **Reward Function**: Profit based on price choice and market share
4. **Convergence Target**: Prices approaching marginal cost

**Results:**
The agents successfully learned to converge to marginal cost pricing, validating the Bertrand Paradox. The learning process showed clear convergence patterns, with prices decreasing over time as agents discovered that undercutting competitors leads to higher market share and profits.

### Optimization Techniques

Our experiments revealed several key optimization techniques that dramatically improve learning performance:

**1. Action Space Alignment:**
Centering the action space around the theoretical Nash equilibrium significantly improves convergence speed and accuracy. Instead of allowing agents to explore the entire action space, we focused on actions near the optimal strategy.

**2. Reward Shaping:**
Adding a bonus reward for actions close to the Nash equilibrium guides agents toward optimal strategies. This technique helps overcome the exploration challenge in large action spaces.

**3. Adaptive Learning Rates:**
Implementing learning rates that decrease over time helps stabilize the learning process. Early episodes focus on exploration, while later episodes focus on exploitation of learned strategies.

**4. Episode Scaling:**
Increasing the number of training episodes from 5,000 to 15,000 led to significantly better convergence. More experience allows agents to better estimate the value of different strategies.

### Convergence Analysis

**Performance Metrics:**
We measured convergence using several key metrics:
- **Quantity Error**: Absolute difference between learned and theoretical Nash equilibrium quantities
- **Price Error**: Absolute difference between learned and theoretical Nash equilibrium prices
- **Convergence Time**: Number of episodes required to reach stable strategies
- **Strategy Stability**: Variance in learned strategies over time

**Learning Dynamics:**
The learning process exhibits distinct phases:
1. **Exploration Phase**: High variance, random strategy selection
2. **Learning Phase**: Decreasing variance, strategy refinement
3. **Convergence Phase**: Low variance, stable near-optimal strategies

**Economic Validation:**
The learned strategies closely match theoretical predictions:
- Cournot agents learned to produce quantities near (a-c)/(3b)
- Bertrand agents learned to set prices near marginal cost
- Market outcomes align with game-theoretic predictions

## Conclusion
