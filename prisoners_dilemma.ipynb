        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most famous examples in game theory, illustrating how rational individuals might not cooperate, even when it appears that cooperation would be in their mutual interest. It demonstrates the conflict between individual rationality and collective rationality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Two suspects are arrested by the police. The police have insufficient evidence for a conviction on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cooperate (C)**: Remain silent and betray the other prisoner\n",
        "- **Defect (D)**: Confess and betray the other prisoner\n",
        "\n",
        "The possible outcomes depend on the choices of both prisoners:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Both Cooperate**: Both prisoners betray each other, both get moderate sentences\n",
        "2. **Both Defect**: Both prisoners remain silent, both get light sentences  \n",
        "3. **One Cooperates, One Defects**: The cooperating prisoner goes free, the defecting prisoner gets a heavy sentence\n",

        "\n",
        "The Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates a fundamental challenge in strategic decision-making: the tension between individual and collective rationality. While the Nash equilibrium leads to mutual defection, understanding this dilemma helps us design better institutions, policies, and strategies that promote cooperation and mutual benefit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is that cooperation often requires mechanisms beyond pure individual rationality - whether through repeated interaction, reputation effects, or institutional design.\n"
